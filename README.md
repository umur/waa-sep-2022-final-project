Property management portal is a web-based java project where house owners and customers can exchange information effectively and inexpensively. This system provides a user-friendly interface, satisfying the needs of the consumers.

 - Admin manages all the users of the system. 
 - Customer is the one who is looking for a property. She/He can search the properties according to the requirements and get the results accordingly and submit an application for the property.

Dashboard Page for admins:
- Display the last 10 properties rented.
